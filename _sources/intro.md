# Welcome

Welcome to the website accompanying the [Open Energy Transition](https://openenergytransition.org/) course for the Stanford Training. This course was originally developed [Dr. Fabian Neumann](https://neumann.fyi) at [Department of Digital Transformation of Energy Systems at TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/ensys) and adjusted by [Dr. Martha Frysztacki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marthamaria93/) and [Dr. des. Maximilian Parzen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximilian-parzen-b047a1126/).

On this website you will find practical introductions to many Python packages that are useful for dealing with energy data and building energy system models. Course materials other than practical introductions to Python packages for students at TU Berlin are provided on [ISIS](https://isis.tu-berlin.de/course/view.php?id=35495).

The course covers tutorials and examples for getting started with Python, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `geopandas`, `cartopy`, `rasterio`, `atlite`, `networkx`, `pyomo`, `pypsa`, `plotly`, `hvplot`, and `streamlit`. Topics covered include:

- time series analysis (e.g. wind and solar production)
- tabular data (e.g. LNG terminals, power plants, industrial sites)
- geographical data (e.g. location of power plants)
- data visualisation
- converting weather data to renewable generation
- land eligibility analysis (e.g. where can we build wind turbines)
- optimisation
- electricity market modelling
- power flow modelling (linearised)
- capacity expansion planning
- sector-coupling
- interactive visualisation and dashboarding

## Using Python without a local installation

You can even start the course without a local Python installation using online services like  [Google Colab (colab.google)](https://colab.google) which provide an online Python version
in a [Jupyter Notebook](jupyter.org/) environment.
