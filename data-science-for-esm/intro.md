# Python Introduction Tutorial

Welcome to the **Python Introduction Tutorial**, designed for participants interested in energy system modeling. This tutorial provides a foundational introduction to Python, focusing on key packages essential for data analysis and visualization: `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`.

Please note that this is not a comprehensive Python course. Instead, it serves as a stepping stone for those new to the language, equipping them with the basics needed for energy system modeling.

For a more in-depth exploration of Python in energy system modeling, we recommend the following course by Dr. Fabian Neumann:

ðŸ”— **[Data Science for Energy System Modelling](https://moseskonto.tu-berlin.de/moses/modultransfersystem/bolognamodule/beschreibung/anzeigen.html?nummer=31027&version=2&sprache=2)** â€“ A comprehensive resource covering advanced methodologies and applications.

## Installing the package manager `conda`

Python and nearly all of the software packages in the scientific python
ecosystem are [open-source](https://opensource.org/). Coordinating the
compatibility between these different packages and their multiple versions can be difficult! Fortunately, the problem is solved by using a Python
_distribution_ and/or _package manager_. You should use a package manager!

### Anaconda

The easiest way to set up a full-stack scientific Python deployment is to use a
Python distribution. This is an installation of Python with a set of curated
packages which are known to work together.

For instance, you can install on your computer the popular
[Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).
Follow the link above to obtain a one-click installers for your operating system.

For **Linux and MacOS users**, you can access the command line by opening the _terminal_ program.

For **Windows users**, you should first install Anaconda (described above) or `miniconda` (described below), which gives you access to the "Anaconda Prompt" desktop application. (Instructions for this are given on the [Anaconda Website](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/#write-a-python-program-using-anaconda-prompt-or-terminal).)

From the Anaconda Prompt, you should be able to run `conda` and other shell commands.

### Lightweight `miniconda`

If you don't want to download a large file like the Anaconda Python Distribution (ca. 800 MB), there is a
lightweight alternative installation called `miniconda`.
Follow the link to the [Miniconda Installation](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) page and use, for example, the [quick command line install](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/#quick-command-line-install).

### Google Colab

You can even start the course without a local Python installation using online services like  [Google Colab (colab.google)](https://colab.google) which provide an online Python version
in a [Jupyter Notebook](jupyter.org/) environment. This requires a Google account.

## Managing environments with `conda`

Python coupled with a package manager provides a way to make isolated,
reproducible _environments_ where you have control over all installed packages
and configurations.

First, check that you have access to `conda` in your _terminal_ or _Anaconda Prompt_ application by typing:

    conda --version

Then, make sure that your conda installation is up to date:

    conda update -n base -c conda-forge conda

To create a conda environment, you execute the following command:

    conda create --name my_environment python=3.11 numpy

To use this environment, simply _activate_ it by executing:

    conda activate my_environment

You should now see the string `(my_environment)` prepended to your prompt.
Now, any execution of Python will use the packages installed in your _environment_ "my_environment".

To install additional packages into your environment:

    conda install <package-name>

Some packages are community-maintained (e.g. `conda-forge`) and require you to specify a different "channel", i.e. a different source:

    conda install -c conda-forge <package-name>

You can deactivate your environment by typing:

    conda deactivate

To see all the environments on your system:

    conda env list

To get a complete summary of all the packages installed in your environment, run

    conda list

If you want to permanently remove an environment and delete all the data
associated with it:

    conda env remove --name my_environment --all

A conda environment can also be defined through an `environment.yaml` file. With that file, a new environment with the exact
configuration can be installed by executing

    conda env create -f my_environment.yml

For extensive documentation on using environments, please see
[the conda documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html).

## Environment for this course: `esm-ws-24-25`

### ... with `conda` (recommended)

The latest environment specification for this course can be downloaded under the following link as a [`YAML`-file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML):

https://github.com/fneum/data-science-for-esm/blob/main/environment.yaml

There is a download button at the top-right corner.

After navigating to the folder where the `environment.yaml` file is stored ([here](https://tutorials.codebar.io/command-line/introduction/tutorial.html)'s a tutorial how to navigate with the command line),
you can reate this environment using `conda`

    conda env create -f environment.yaml

Activate this environment

    conda activate esm-ws-24-25

This environment should be sufficient for all of your work in this course.

The environment has to be activated whenever you open a new terminal,
*before* starting a new Jupyter window with

    jupyter lab

### ... with `pip`

If you want to use `pip` for managing your environment, download

https://github.com/fneum/data-science-for-esm/blob/main/requirements.txt

There is a download button at the top-right corner.

After navigating to the folder where the `requirements.txt` file is stored,
you can install the required packages with

    pip install -r requirements.txt

This should allow you to start a new Jupyter window:

    jupyter lab

## JupyterLab

[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io) will be our primary method for
interacting with Python code. It runs in your web browser.
The following documentation pages might be worth a visit:

- [The JupyterLab Interface](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html)
- [Working with Files](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/files.html)
- [The Text Editor](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/file_editor.html)
- [Notebooks](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/notebook.html)
- [Terminals](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/terminal.html)
- [Managing Kernels and Terminals](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/running.html)

## Markdown

Throughout the course, you might want to write rich text documents using Markdown.
This is also very common in Jupyter:

- [Official Markdown Documentation](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
