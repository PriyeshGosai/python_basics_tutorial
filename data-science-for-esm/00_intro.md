# Welcome

Welcome to the website accompanying the [Open Energy Transition](https://openenergytransition.org/) course for the Stanford Training. This course was originally developed [Dr. Fabian Neumann](https://neumann.fyi) at [Department of Digital Transformation of Energy Systems at TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/ensys) and adjusted by [Dr. Martha Frysztacki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marthamaria93/) and [Maximilian Parzen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximilian-parzen-b047a1126/).

While we cover here only a tailored `pypsa` training, there is much more learning material available at [https://fneum.github.io/data-science-for-esm/intro.html](https://fneum.github.io/data-science-for-esm/intro.html) including tutorials on `Python`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `geopandas`, `cartopy`, `rasterio`, `atlite`, `networkx`, `pyshed`, `pyomo`, `pypsa`, `plotly`, `hvplot`, and `streamlit`.

## Using Python without a local installation

You can even start the course without a local Python installation using online services like  [Google Colab (colab.google)](https://colab.google) which provide an online Python version
in a [Jupyter Notebook](jupyter.org/) environment.
